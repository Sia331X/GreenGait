# 🍃 GreenGait 🍃

**GreenGait** is a Web3 rewards platform that transforms physical activity into real digital value using the Solana blockchain. With a secure, Wi-Fi-enabled wearable device (ESP32), every step you take is cryptographically signed and submitted to the blockchain – all in real time.
🏃 + ✅ → 💰 on-chain.

## 🌐 Architecture Overview

🔹 **ESP32-WROOM-32D**
A microcontroller that simulates steps via a button. Sends step data via MQTT over TLS using mutual certificate authentication.

🔐 **TLS Mutual Authentication**
Secure communication using custom client certificates and a trusted CA, protecting against unauthorized devices.

🧠 **Rust Backend Validator**
Receives messages via MQTT, validates authenticity (HMAC + timestamp), then logs valid steps on-chain via a Solana smart contract.

⛓️ **Solana Anchor Program**
Deployed on Devnet. Uses Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) to store step data per user per day. Tokens are minted automatically every 3 steps.

📡 **EMQX Broker (Google Cloud VPS)**
A hardened MQTT broker with TLS, ACL rules, and certificate-based access control.

🖥️ **Frontend Interface**
Visualizes your step history and blockchain rewards in a simple dashboard.

## ✅ Features Implemented

* ✅ **ESP32 device** with WiFi + MQTT + TLS client auth
* ✅ **TLS mutual authentication** via custom certificates
* ✅ **HMAC-SHA256** signature generation on device
* ✅ **JSON payload** with: `steps`, `timestamp`, `nonce`, `signature`
* ✅ **Rust backend**:

  * MQTT TLS client
  * HMAC & timestamp validation
  * PDA-based step tracking and token minting
* ✅ **Solana Anchor program** with `log_step` instruction
* ✅ **Solana Devnet** deployment and testing

---

## 🔐 Security Architecture

* HMAC-SHA256 signed payloads (shared secret)
* Timestamp validation to prevent replay attacks (±30s)
* TLS mutual authentication (ESP32 ↔ EMQX ↔ backend)
* EMQX Broker enforces certificate-based access and ACL rules
* Backend runs on a hardened Google Cloud VPS with TLS
* PDA ensures unique, tamper-proof on-chain logs per `(user, day)`

## 🔁 Example Flow

1. Press the button → ESP32 sends a signed JSON payload
2. EMQX broker securely forwards it to the backend
3. Backend verifies the HMAC + timestamp → logs it on-chain
4. If steps are divisible by 3, a token is minted
5. Frontend displays user stats (WIP)

## 🛠 How to Run Locally

### 1. Flash the ESP32

Upload `ESP32.ino` from `firmware/` using Arduino IDE.
Make sure `certificates.h` contains:

* `ca.crt`
* `client.crt`
* `client.key`

### 2. Start the Rust Backend

```bash
cd backend
cargo run
```

Make sure these files exist in `certs/`:

```
ca.crt
client.crt
client.key
stepmint-validator.json (Solana keypair)
```

### 3. Run the Solana Tests

```bash
cd solana_program
anchor build
anchor test
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="test.png" alt="Tests" width="850">
  <br>
  <em>Tests</em>
</p>

### 4. Deploy the Solana Program

```bash
anchor deploy
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="deploy.png" alt="Deploy" width="850">
  <br>
  <em>Deploy</em>
</p>
